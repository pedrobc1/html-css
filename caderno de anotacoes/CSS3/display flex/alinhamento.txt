we'll always use the display flex in the parent element
      parent  .conteiner{
            display: flex;
            background-color: grey;
        }
       child .item{
            background-color: black;
            color: white;
            border: 1px solid rgb(46, 153, 60);
            flex: auto;
            text-align: center;
        }
the flex auto that we see in the child will turn the items into fluid div that will take all the parent width 

parent codes------------------------

flex direction
it will determine the direction that the childs will take
flex direction row ----->
flex direction row reverse <------
flex direction column: from top to bottom
all of it has his reverse option

axis (eixos)

main axis ------->
cross axis from top to bottom
each axis has their start and end. we can imagine it like a cartesian plan

the reverse of the flex directions will reverse the axis directions
the main axis will be always disposed by the start of the items.

flex wrap
it determines the behavior of the parent : if it will wrap or not
flex wrap, by default, will come as nowrap
flex wrap: wrap - it will wrap in the direction of the cross axis
flex wrap: wrap reverse - it will wrap in the opposite direction of the cross axis
flex flow is the shorthand = flex direction + flex wrap

justify content
it will align the items in the main axis
flex-start - the first item will stick to the main start
flex-end - the first item will stick to the main end
center - the items will be disposed in the center of the main axis
space-between - the items will be disposed equally in the main axis : the first item in the main start and the last item in the main end
space-evenly - the items will be disposed equally in the mais axis : before and after the items we will have the same spacing
space-around - the items have something like a 'margin' on their sides, so in the main start we have the spacing of only one 'margin', and between the items we have two 'margin' : one of each item

align-items
it will align the items in the cross axis
stretch - is the default value. it will stretch the items in the cross axis
flex start - the first item will stretch to the cross start
flex end - 

child codes--------------------
flex: auto - the child will fill all the size of the div
when you use the flex auto and the flex wrap togheter, the child will only wrap when there is no more space for the div content
